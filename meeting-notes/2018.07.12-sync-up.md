# 2018.07.12 Sync Up

## Participants

* Jacky
* Thiago
* Ravi

## Context

DML team will hire the mobile devs for the mobile app (currently looking at junior devs in Taiwan and HK)

The majority of the work will be on the backend:

* CRUD jobs
* aggregate results from the jobs ==> compile results
* store algos that the dev uploads
* distribute algos
* reporting: turning output data after post-processing into reports

We are building a DApp: a lot of the persistance layer will happen in smart contracts

## Homomorphic Encryption (HE)

Homomorphic encryption (HE) will be key to protect the userbase and to prevent people from stealing algos (to maintain integrity of the algo)

* still working on viability, depending on research
* current state of HE is not production ready

### Thaigo's Observations:

* technology still very limited; still looking at OpenMined
* any other approaches other than HE?
* they are already limited for math operations, so ML applications would be ambitious
* potentially recrypt with a one-time key? But if you interrupt the network request, the user could have access to both.

## Frontend

### Challenges

* pre-/post-processing
   * modal design > stepper design
   * console - JSBin
* sending data back to the backend
* integrating with smart contracts
* onboarding - ideally without dependency on MetaMask

### Blockers

* figuring out pre/post data as part of the execution flow
* manually convert the python script into JS
* test that executing JS with the algo works

### Target

Implement new design into production

## Roadmap

Treat current invision mocks as final site.

### RFCs

* Front-end RFC: proposed architected, format, monitoring
* Back-end RFC: proposed architected, format, monitoring
* Mobile RFC: on hold until the mobile team is built out

### 1 Month

4-5 meetings for planning; first half informational, second half expectations

All meetings will be recorded.

Technical planning meetings will primarily be context-dumping.

Goal: monthly milestones for deliverables

### 1 Year

* mobile app that can recieve ML algos from the backend
* run them on the frontend
* and send the results back to the backend

### 2 Years

Entire decentralized backend with a network of nodes

## Contacts

* Dustin - smart contract experience
* Matt/George - distributed systems experience
* Matt - his input on HE?

## Notices

* Ravi will be available sporadically for the last week of July
* Ravi will be OOO in the mountains for the first three weeks of August

## Action Items

### Ravi

* implement console
* build out data processing

### Thaigo

* chat with Matt OpenMined

### Jacky

* critique Pixelmatters DML mocks
* set up client meeting for Tuesday
* prepare product docs for first tech planning meeting
