## Abstract

Implement the DML Marketplace payment hub & Smart Contracts for handling the payment of job executions.

### Glossary

* **BC** - Business Client, the company/user who's creating & funding DML jobs to be executed by **DO**s
* **DO** - Device Owner, the end-user who's running the DML mobile app on Android or iOS
* **DML** - The DML Marketplace entitiy, anything that's handled by "the system" and not **BC**s or **DO**s

## (Proposed) Architecture

* Create a **State Channel** that will be used to facilitate payment's between DML, BCs and DOs

### Assumptions/contraints
* The BC **SHOULD** pay for the gas fee for creating job
* The DO and DML **SHOULD NOT** have to pay for gas when distributing tokens
* The DO **SHOULD** pay for the gas fee when claiming the tokens by closing the channel


## Payment Flow

The payment flow is as follow, in non-technical terms:

1. BO send tokens to DML
2. DML send jobs to DO
3. DML send tokens to DO after DO has completed a job

### 1 - BO send tokens to DML

* This can be an on-chain transactions, as this will most likely happen less often and will involve a fairly high amount (e.g. 50k tokens).
* These tokens will be send to the UNIDIRECTINAL contract to add to the collateralized balance

### 2 - DML send jobs to DO

* Purely backend. No blockchain work necessary.

### 3 - DML send tokens to DO
* these will be micro-transaciton that happen frequently (~2 tokens per DO per job)
* For that reason, we need these to happen in payment channels
* UNDIRECTIONAL channel can only have one sender and one receiver, meaning that many channels has to be created for many DOs

## DO Job execution & Payment Flow

1. DO download app
2. DO start receiving jobs
3. DOs earning will be initially kept by DML (backend)
4. DOs will see that they have earn
5. When DO wants to claim tokens, they will click a button inside the mobile app
6. The app/backend will then create **State Channel**, & claim tokens to channel

The channel is only established for this relationship (sender=DML, receiver=DO).

#### Observations:

* DML would be custodian for just the first batch of tokens.
* After the user claim once, they will have a channel open where they have custodianship.
