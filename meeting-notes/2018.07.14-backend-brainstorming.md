# 2018.07.14 Backend Brainstorming

## Participants

* Matt
* Thiago
* Dan
* ~~Jacky~~

## Goal of the meeting

Analyse the avaiable solutions we have to:

1. Protect the algorithm/model for transfering it to the device
2. Run it on the device
3. Report back (to the backend) with the aggregated results

### OpenMined - PySyft

* Good for training on distributed data
* Good for running the algorithm on multiple devices

### Homomorphic encryption

* Even if we had a really stable & production ready solution, we wouldn't be abble to run the *encryted* ML algorithm using it
* We don't need to protect the algo on "run time", we need to protect it during payload delivery to the device

## Solution proposed

* Use **keypairs** to obfuscate the model parameterss
* Use **root certificates** to allow the device to connect only to the DML back-end
* Make the client (mobile app) so it can only connect to the DML back-end using the created CA certificate
* Make the back-end exchange keypairs with the device & encrypt the algo model params using the **public key** of the device, decripting it using hte **private key** on the device

### To research / Action items

* Create a root certificate for the DML enterprise
