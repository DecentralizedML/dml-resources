## Abstract

Rework the current DML marketplace prototype, separating the existing backend from [the frontend][prototype] while implementing good practices and the remaining features.

## Proposed Architecture

* Backend application to provide API access for the frontend application
* RESTful endpoints separated by resources
  * GraphQL?
* Exception tracking via a 3rd party provider (Sentry? Airbrake?)

## Proposed Implementation

* Language - TODO (currently **Node**)
* Framework - TODO (currently **Express.js**)
* Database - TODO (currently **MongoDB**)
* TDD - Test Driven Development, to ensure code quality & reliability
* CI - Continuous Integration (TravisCI?)
* JWT - JSON Web Token (authentication)
* Secrets storage (API keys, DB credentials, etc.) using environment variables
* Integration w/ blockchain?

#### Proposed endpoint collections

* `/v1/users` - Authentication & user data
* `/v1/algorithms` - List & upload algorithms
* `/v1/bounties` - List & create bounties
* `/v1/bounties/ID/submissions` - List & create bounties submissions
* `/v1/jobs` - List & create job requests

## Test Cases

TODO

## Deployment

* Deployment of the `master` branch on every change
* Continuous deployment through the continuous integration tool we decide to use

## Monitoring
