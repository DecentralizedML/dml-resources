## Desired Auth/Login Flow

1. screen for email and password
1. after submit, hits backend, gets access token
1. user is still not done onboarding
1. update user profile on the backend
1. now they need to confirm their Metamask account
1. if the user says yes, we'll persist their pubic key to the backend

* with this flow, there is no need to sign anything
* make sure that the user has Metamask
* make sure to confirm with the user that they are using the correct account
* we don't provide users to change their associated MetaMask account

* we are NOT using a security word approach because it is redundant/useless

* we need to persist their public key and their onboarding status (accounted created, profile filled out, active) - backend: some set enums

## Upload Algorithm Flow

* we're getting everything working in a centralized way and then modularly swap out with decentralized components
* associate algo record in the DB with the developer's public address
* main issue: when the algo is being used, where do the earnings go to:
  * payment should go directly to user's wallet
