## Abstract
Work out the overall architecture and and featutes needed for the first implementation of the Decentralized Machine Learning protocol smart contracts.

## (Proposed) Architecture
Utilize an external storage contract and a hub and spoke toplogy to create modular and upgradeable smart contracts with a permanent data store.

## (Proposed) Implementation
Contracts
1) DmlBase - Contains interface for DML Storage and moderator functions for checking if address has certain roles
2) DmlExternalStorage - primary persistent storage for DML smart contracts.  All primative types are stored as mappings with bytes32 keys that are hashes of the name space and value being stored, and primative data types as values. This allows for one mapping to hold the values for several differet functions and use cases.  The contract has internal functions for setting, getting, and deleting values in mappings. Only register contracts can write to the storage contract.
3) DmlMarktplace
4) BountyFactory - Creates and tracks Bounty contracts
5) Bounty - 
6) DmlUpgrade - takes care of upgrading contact if they need updated functionality, or have bugs, and can add new contracts.


## Test cases
Unit tests can be written by first compling and deploying the smart contracts to a local Ganche and then interacting with them via Web3.

## Deployment
Smart contracts can be deployed to a local test network for development and then to oe of the Ethereum test networks for beta testing and finally to the main ethereum network.
