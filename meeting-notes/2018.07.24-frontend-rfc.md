## Abstract

Reimplement the current DML marketplace prototype into a production-ready web application conforming to the latest Pixelmatters designs.

https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/DYKZFWJGX73

## (Proposed) Architecture

* Progressive Web App
* have a service worker that lets the user know that their contract has been created
* optimistic UI for non-critical actions (critical actions include purchases, uploads, etc.) --- other actions can implement optimistic UI to reduce received wait/delay for the user

### Redux Store Shape

```js
{

}
```

### Code Execution Flow

- framework and library
- pre-processing...
- pre/post returning Promise
- what will the API be for dealing with Promises

### Integration Path with Backend and Smart Contracts`

Backend Reference for Routes:
https://github.com/kyokan/dml-resources/blob/master/meeting-notes/2018.07.18-backend-rfc-proposal.md#proposed-endpoint-collections

Functionality | Route | HTTP Method | Expected Response | Status Code | Public? | Access Controlled?

update algo

* algos stored centralized at present
* all jobs and bounties stored in smart contracts as lists
* load lists into redux store
  * for each of the addresses in the list, you have to call for the actual data
* currently network injection queue (to basically stagger loading data)
* backend cache?
* primary goal: minimize frontend communication with smart contracts
* define purchase flow for an Algo - developer has to send ETH to algo developer, once that is done, the developer gets access to the algo

Two Paths:

1. when the user hits purchase, the user will send DML directly to developer; backend watches blockchain to see when the transaction goes through; on success, enable access
  - keep track of transaction ID;
  - backend watches the blockchain (because an auxiliary database transaction needs to be completed)
  - drawback: if the user drops off between sending a transaction and getting back a transaction ID (perhaps the API goes down)
  - depends on:
    * MetaMask always succeeding in sending the transaction ID,
    * no issues in getting a transaction ID and sending it to the backend
    * the state of the frontend matching the state of the backend (if we wanted to store the transaction ID in `localStorage`)
2. marketplace smart contract: receive payment - disperse payment to the right developer, turn on access to algo in the smart contract and all the state regarding algo control lives in the smart contract
  - you can either call the smart contract to determine state OR have the backend poll the smart contract every 15 seconds and mirror the state for us to consume
  
Both paths require watching of the blockchain, gas is similarly priced.

## (Proposed) Implementation

### React

* maybe Preact - can swap out at production for performance gains (low priority)
* strive for compound components

### Redux

* application-level store

### Styled Components

* CSS-in-JS for more powerful processing
* keeps solution in-line with Kyokan UI

### Kyokan UI

* leveraging our own in-house frontend framework for rapid interface building
* about 3-4 weeks to build out and test components

### Embedded Code Editor/Console

* ACE / CodeMirror
  * CodeMirror is more mobile-friendly
  * ACE is a more mature product
* JSConsole?
  * currently not easily embedded into our workflow

### MetaMask

* currently MetaMask gives us a wallet for the user to use without us having to build our own
* we would have to build our own wallet to remove this dependency, so we'll stick with MetaMask
* polling the backend for new blockchain transaction cache data

## Test Cases

* Unit testing at the kyokan-ui component level
* Enzyme/Jest testing of the frontend
* feature testing? mock Metamask?

* test: buying an algo, uploading algo, creating algo, creating bounties
* test components which touch these paths: container/reducer logic
* ideally, we can mock these components out to avoid Selenium
* main concern: regression on story flow

## Deployment

* deploy `dev` to staging
* deploy `master` ad hoc

## Analytics

* Google Analytics: user demographics
* as long as we have the mechanism to log actions as we want
* Redux middleware - log all actions alongside Redux state
* **make sure to filter all Personally Identifiable Information (PII) before logging: user's private key, etc.**

## Experiments

N/A

## Monitoring

* know if there some unexpected error being thrown (Sentry)
* a core story flow is breaking - log entire flow and monitor for spike in success/failure (no anomalies)
