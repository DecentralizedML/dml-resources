## Abstract

Reimplement the current DML marketplace prototype into a production-ready web application conforming to the latest Pixelmatters designs.

https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/DYKZFWJGX73

## (Proposed) Architecture

* Progressive Web App
* have a service worker that lets the user know that their contract has been created
* optimistic UI for non-critical actions (critical actions include purchases, uploads, etc.) --- other actions can implement optimistic UI to reduce received wait/delay for the user

### Redux Store Shape

```js
{
  algorithms: {
    isBuyingAlgo: false,
    isFetchingAlgos: false,
    isRequestingPurchasedState: false,
    map: {},
    myAlgos: [],
    order: [],
    purchased: {} 
  },
  bounties: {
    allBounties: [],
    allBountiesMap: {},
    createdByMe: [],
    isCreatingBounty: false,
    isDownloadingSubmission: false,
    isLoadingAllBounties: false,
    isLoadingAllBountiesCreatedByMe: false,
    isSubmittingBounty: false,
    isUpdatingBounty: false,
    submissions: {}
  },
  jobs: {
    byAlgo: {},
    createJobErrorMessage: '',
    isCreatingJob: false,
    isFetchingJobHistory: false
  },
  metamask: {
    accounts: [],
    dmlAllowance: 0,
    dmlBallance: 0,
    ethBalance: 0.0,
    hasWeb3: false,
    isApprovingDml: false,
    isLocked: false,
    network: '',
  },
  user: {
    emailAddress: '',
    firstName: '',
    hasSignedUp: false,
    isFetchingUser: false,
    isSigningUp: false,
    jwt: '',
    lastName: '',
  }
}
```

### Code Execution Flow

#### Algorithm Upload

Developers cannot advance if there are any errors.

##### Steps

1. Enter information
2. Code editor and console to allow users to enter data **pre-processing** code prepopulated with some sample data (or custom uploaded data)
3. Upload a file (machine learning algorithm weight file)
4. Click a button to run pre-processing code, run through algo, and output raw data to a downloadable text file
5. Code editor and console to allow users to enter data **post-processing** code prepopulated with some sample data (or custom uploaded data)
6. Click a button to run pre-processing code, run through algo, run post-processing code, and then output raw data to a downloadable text file
7. See a summary screen
8. If everything looks good, submit

##### Tools

* Code Editor: `react-ace`
* Console: custom Kyokan code referencing `JSBin`'s implementation

##### Considerations

If the user starts the process and stops midway, they should be able to pick up from where they left off. Perhaps add a save button for each given step?

###### Waiting Periods

After hitting submit, there are two waiting periods:

1. smart contracts - speed dependent on Ethereum network
2. review period - one of the DML engineers will manually review the algo
    - if approved, will be uploaded
    - if not approved, will stay pending
    - if rejected, some communication with developer (most likely email)
    
###### Async

Because the execution of the pre-/post-processing code will be asynchronous, they will return Promises which will allow us to handle all code execution asynchronously. The placeholder example code that will prepopulate the pre-/post-processing code editor boxes will return [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) and we will carry out some simple front-end validation to test that the code is in the format of a Promise (basically check for a `.then()` function). 

### Integration Path with Backend and Smart Contracts

Backend Reference for Routes:
https://github.com/kyokan/dml-resources/blob/master/meeting-notes/2018.07.18-backend-rfc-proposal.md#proposed-endpoint-collections

Functionality | Route | HTTP Method | Expected Response | Status Code | Public? | Access Controlled?
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
update algo

* algos stored centralized at present
* all jobs and bounties stored in smart contracts as lists
* load lists into redux store
  * for each of the addresses in the list, you have to call for the actual data
* currently network injection queue (to basically stagger loading data)
* backend cache?
* primary goal: minimize frontend communication with smart contracts
* define purchase flow for an Algo - developer has to send ETH to algo developer, once that is done, the developer gets access to the algo

#### Two Paths to Purchase Algorithms:

1. when the user hits purchase, the user will send DML directly to developer; backend watches blockchain to see when the transaction goes through; on success, enable access (less ideal)
  - keep track of transaction ID;
  - backend watches the blockchain (because an auxiliary database transaction needs to be completed)
  - drawback: if the user drops off between sending a transaction and getting back a transaction ID (perhaps the API goes down)
  - depends on:
    * MetaMask always succeeding in sending the transaction ID,
    * no issues in getting a transaction ID and sending it to the backend
    * the state of the frontend matching the state of the backend (if we wanted to store the transaction ID in `localStorage`)
  - two asynchronous transactions which can become unsynced
  
2. **marketplace smart contract**: receive payment - disperse payment to the right developer, turn on access to algo in the smart contract and all the state regarding algo control lives in the smart contract
  - you can either call the smart contract to determine state OR have the backend poll the smart contract every 15 seconds and mirror the state for us to consume
  - removes race conditions: one synchronous transaction that will be reversed upon failure
  
Both paths require watching of the blockchain, gas is similarly priced.

## (Proposed) Implementation

### React

* maybe Preact - can swap out at production for performance gains (low priority)
* strive for compound components

### Redux

* application-level store

### Styled Components

* CSS-in-JS for more powerful processing
* keeps solution in-line with Kyokan UI

### Kyokan UI

* leveraging our own in-house frontend framework for rapid interface building
* about 3-4 weeks to build out and test components

### Embedded Code Editor/Console

* ACE / CodeMirror
  * CodeMirror is more mobile-friendly
  * ACE is a more mature product
* JSConsole?
  * currently not easily embedded into our workflow

### MetaMask

* currently MetaMask gives us a wallet for the user to use without us having to build our own
* we would have to build our own wallet to remove this dependency, so we'll stick with MetaMask
* polling the backend for new blockchain transaction cache data

## Test Cases

* Unit testing at the kyokan-ui component level
* Enzyme/Jest testing of the frontend
* feature testing? mock Metamask?

* test: buying an algo, uploading algo, creating algo, creating bounties
* test components which touch these paths: container/reducer logic
* ideally, we can mock these components out to avoid Selenium
* main concern: regression on story flow

## Deployment

* deploy `dev` to staging
* deploy `master` ad hoc

## Analytics

* Google Analytics: user demographics
* as long as we have the mechanism to log actions as we want
* Redux middleware - log all actions alongside Redux state
* **make sure to filter all Personally Identifiable Information (PII) before logging: user's private key, etc.**

## Experiments

N/A

## Monitoring

* know if there some unexpected error being thrown (Sentry)
* a core story flow is breaking - log entire flow and monitor for spike in success/failure (no anomalies)
