## DML

### Accounts

* In future versions, there will not be a debit limit.

### Algorithms

* Job History and Reviews are for v2.

### Upload

* The Category button approach won't scale, so we should change to a dropdown
* Instead of a list of tags, we will start with either a dropdown or a multiselect with a bunch of predetermined tags (this is to avoid custom tag monitoring, etc.)
* Data: GPS, Photos, SMS; in the future, we'll have a dropdown with multiselect instead of a radio button

#### Steps

Users cannot advance if there are any errors

1. Enter information
2. Code editor and console to allow users to enter data **pre-processing** code prepopulated with some sample data (or custom uploaded data)
3. Upload a file (machine learning algorithm weight file)
4. Click a button to run pre-processing code, run through algo, and output raw data to a downloadable text file
5. Code editor and console to allow users to enter data **post-processing** code prepopulated with some sample data (or custom uploaded data)
6. Click a button to run pre-processing code, run through algo, run post-processing code, and then output raw data to a downloadable text file
7. See a summary screen
8. If everything looks good, submit

If the user starts the process and stops midway, they should be able to pick up from where they left off. Perhaps add a save button for each given step?

After hitting submit, there are two waiting periods:

1. smart contracts - speed dependent on Ethereum network
2. review period - one of the DML engineers will manually review the algo
    - if approved, will be uploaded
    - if not approved, will stay pending
    - if rejected, some communication with developer (most likely email)

In V2 design, there might be two marketplaces: one for developer and one for business clients

## Kyokan

Jacky is interested in a Kyokan rebrand / website redesign. Pixelmatters will get back with a quote.
