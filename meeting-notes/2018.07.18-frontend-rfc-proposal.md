## Abstract

Reimplement the current DML marketplace prototype into a production-ready web application conforming to the latest Pixelmatters designs.

https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/DYKZFWJGX73

## (Proposed) Architecture

* Progressive Web App

## (Proposed) Implementation

### React

* maybe Preact - can swap out at production for performance gains
* strive for compound components

### Redux

* application-level store
* `Vue.js(?)`

### SASS

* styling
* `CSS Modules or BEM?`

### Kyokan UI

* `MORE CONTEXT`
* about 3-4 weeks to build out and test components

### Embedded Code Editor/Console

* ACE / CodeMirror
  * CodeMirror is more mobile-friendly
  * ACE is a more mature product
* JSConsole?
  * currently not easily embedded into our workflow

### MetaMask

* can we remove dependence?
* Polling for new blockchain transactions

## Test Cases

* Unit testing at the kyokan-ui component level
* Enzyme/Jest testing of the frontend
* feature testing? mock Metamask?

## Deployment

* No need for incremental deployment.

## Analytics

* There has been no discussion of user tracking.
* Google Analytics? Keen? Amplitude?
* What data is most useful for DML?
  * Redux middleware? - track either all or specific Redux actions

## Experiments

N/A

## Monitoring
