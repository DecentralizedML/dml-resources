## Abstract

Reimplement the current DML marketplace prototype into a production-ready web application conforming to the latest Pixelmatters designs.

https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/DYKZFWJGX73

## (Proposed) Architecture

* Progressive Web App
* have a service worker that lets the user know that their contract has been created
* optimistic UI for non-critical actions (critical actions include purchases, uploads, etc.) --- other actions can implement optimistic UI to reduce received wait/delay for the user

* `structure of redux store`
* `how code execution flow works`
* `integration path with backend and smart contracts`

```
* all algos, jobs, bounties stored in smart contracts as lists
* load lists into redux store
  * for each of the addresses in the list, you have to call for the actual data
* currently network injection queue (to basically stagger loading data)
* backend cache?
* primary goal: minimize frontend communication with smart contracts
```

## (Proposed) Implementation

### React

* maybe Preact - can swap out at production for performance gains (low priority)
* strive for compound components

### Redux

* application-level store

### SASS

* styling
* `CSS Modules or BEM?`

### Kyokan UI

* `MORE CONTEXT`
* about 3-4 weeks to build out and test components

### Embedded Code Editor/Console

* ACE / CodeMirror
  * CodeMirror is more mobile-friendly
  * ACE is a more mature product
* JSConsole?
  * currently not easily embedded into our workflow

### MetaMask

* currently MetaMask gives us a wallet for the user to use without us having to build our own
* we would have to build our own wallet to remove this dependency, so we'll stick with MetaMask
* polling the backend for new blockchain transaction cache data

## Test Cases

* Unit testing at the kyokan-ui component level
* Enzyme/Jest testing of the frontend
* feature testing? mock Metamask?

* `test: buying an algo, uploading algo, creating algo, creating bounties`
* `test components which touch these paths`: container/reducer logic
* `ideally, we can mock these components out to avoid Selenium`
* `main concern: regression on story flow`

## Deployment

* deploy `dev` to staging
* deploy `master` ad hoc

## Analytics

```
* Google Analytics: user demographics
* as long as we have the mechanism to log actions as we want
* Redux middleware - log all actions alongside Redux state
* **make sure to filter all Personally Identifiable Information (PII) before logging: user's private key, etc.**
```

## Experiments

N/A

## Monitoring

```
* know if there some unexpected error being thrown (Sentry)
* a core story flow is breaking - log entire flow and monitor for spike in success/failure (no anomalies)
```
